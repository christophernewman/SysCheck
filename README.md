Introduction
------------

  This application provides an opensource system check utility with detailed
functions to make some system administration tasks easier.


--
 NOTE: The Base System Check Utility requires root privledges to properly run
-


Supported Platforms
-------------------

  This software was primarily developed under Ubuntu Mate GNU/Linux, and 
 should run on any similar GNU/Linux development platform.

  Because the software is written with the portable scripting
 language, Python, it should also run under other flavors of Unix/Linux.

  SysCheck has been tested upon the following platforms:

	Ubuntu  	Debian		Ubuntu Mate		Fedora
	Redhat		CentOS

 
   --
  (*) Commands specific to Debian-Based environments for updates/cleanups.
This can be modified to work in other flavors or Linux.



Installing under Linux
---------------------

  From the archive simply unpack in any location.

  It is required that this program be executed by running the following command within the
directory the application files reside:

sudo python SysCheck.py

  After executing the application; a series of commands will print in 
terminal specifying the status of each command, and then log each action.


Configuration
-------------

  As long as Python is installed; the application should not require any
additional configurations

NOTE:

  Optional configurations can be made to match Non-Debian enviroments to
execute certain functions.


Running
-------

  The first time you start the application the check will start 
immediately.


Customization
-------------

  The SysUpdate and SysClean functions for control line12, and control
line14 can be customized to work in other flavors that use different package
management systems and functions.

Logging
-------

  All function outputs are logged into a single output file called check.log
This can be easily updated to a different name of your choice.


Documentation
-------------

  The documentation included with this software includes this
 'README' which explains the usage for this program.


Mailing Lists
-------------

  There are no current mailing lists at this time.
